\section{Computational Problems and Algorithms}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{computational problem} is a relation
  \begin{equation*}
    P \subseteq X \times Y,
  \end{equation*}
  where $X$ is called the set of \emph{instances} and $Y$ is called the sets of
  \emph{solutions}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  We will assume the \emph{random-access machine (RAM)} model of computation as
  our implementaion technology for most of this note.
  In this model, we have an infinite sequence of $w$-bit words, and we assume
  $w = \lceil c \lg n \rceil$ for some constant $c \geq 1$, where $n$ is the
  input size.
  We can perform some basic operations on these words, including
  \begin{itemize}
    \item arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    division),
    \item data movement operations (e.g., load, store, copy), and
    \item control operations (e.g., branch, subroutine call, return).
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given a computational model, an \emph{algorithm} is defined as a finite
  sequence of basic operations that transforms a given input into a unique
  output.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We say that an algorithm \emph{solves} a computational problem
    $P \subseteq X \times Y$ if it transforms every instance $x \in X$ into a
    solution $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in P$.
    \item The \emph{running time} of an algorithm on a specific input is
    defined as the number of basic operations performed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{Asymptotic Notations}
\begin{definition}
  Let $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ be functions.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We write $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if there exists positive constants $c$ and
    $n_0$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
      0 \leq f(n) \leq cg(n)
    \end{equation*}
    holds for any integer $n \geq n_0$.
    \item We write $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ if $g(n) = O(f(n))$.
    \item We write $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $g(n) =
    O(f(n))$.
    \item We write $f(n) = o(g(n))$ if for any real number $c > 0$, there
    exists a positive constant $n_0$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
      0 \leq f(n) < cg(n)
    \end{equation*}
    holds for any integer $n \geq n_0$.
    \item We write $f(n) = \omega(g(n))$ if $g(n) = o(f(n))$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
