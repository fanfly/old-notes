\section{Graphs}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{graph} is a pair
  \begin{equation*}
    G = (V, E)
  \end{equation*}
  of finite sets, where $E$ consists of unordered pairs of elements in $V$.
  The elements of $V$ are called \emph{vertices} of $G$, and the elements of
  $E$ are called \emph{edges} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\section{Paths}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{path} is a graph $P = (V, E)$ with
  \begin{equation*}
    V = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n+1}\}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    E = \{x_1x_2, x_2x_3, \dots, x_nx_{n+1}\}.
  \end{equation*}
  The \emph{length} of a path is defined as the number of edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{cycle} is a graph $C = (V, E)$ with
  \begin{equation*}
    C = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    E = \{x_1x_2, x_2x_3, \dots, x_{n-1}x_n, x_nx_1\}.
  \end{equation*}
  The \emph{length} of a cycle is defined as the number of edges.
\end{definition}

\section{Connectivity}
\begin{definition}
  A graph is \emph{connected} if any two vertices can be linked by a path.
  A graph is \emph{disconnected} if it is not connected.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph.
  We say that a set $S \subseteq V$ \emph{separates} $G$ if $G[V \setminus S]$
  is disconnected.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and let $k$ be a nonnegative integer.
  We say that $G$ is \emph{$k$-connected} if $|V| > k$ and every subset
  $S$ of $V$ with $|S| < k$ does not separate $G$.
\end{definition}
